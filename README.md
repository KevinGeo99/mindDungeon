## Gameplay Elements
### Weapons from groups add meter to a corresponding category while dealing damage and from pickups spawned after killing an enemy with said group. Pickups can also be found in the environment.  Meter will add effects while above a value. High value in a meter will grant bonus effects in addition. Meter depletes over time(or actions maybe), and high amounts of meter simply extend duration

# FBX and Music
## Overall Goals
####  The music is a mix of Low-fi and psychedelics with a pinch of retro/pixel. Well I am using this type of music more for the enevemrt and theme  of the game. I want the player to feel like the environment  is here to mess with them. I do want to make the Music sound like it is over working the player in a mentally way.

## Scheduling
### The production schedule is divided into the following major points:
1. Pre-Production / Discovery – Defining our game, mechanics, learning more about our teammates
2. Concurrent Development of Art and Code Assets – Whiteboxing, designing game mechanic, and seeing what works
3. Integration and Design Balancing – making sure the game is fun and implementing sounds and art
4. Alpha – Testing the current product so far with people at Gameheads to see what can be improved
5. QA – Testing the product so far with people at Gameheads to see what can be improved
6. eta – Improving upon the game with the recommendations from Gameheads members and continuously playtesting it and getting more feedback 
7. Deployment and Presentation – Continuous polish and prep for Showcase
### After "The Showcase" Breakdown
8. Polishing and uploading to Itch.io – With your team, discuss what was the feedback given to you and how you will address these in fixes/bugs? Also, start figuring out what will the promo art look like and what inside the game trailer be released and shown off
